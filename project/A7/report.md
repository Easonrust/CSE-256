# Assignment 7: Societal & Ethical Implications of Language Technologies

## Part 1. The Game

### Q1 Which NLP task is described by the author as a game of guessing the missing word?

Filling-in-the-blank task.

## Part 2: Opportunities and Challenges

### Q2 According to the author, what kind of jobs could be lost in the future because of software like GPT-3? Name three such jobs . Which of the three jobs is the least likely to be replaced by GPT-3-like models anytime soon, and why?

Such jobs can be customer service, writing computer software, writing computer software.

In my opinion, customer service is the least likely to be replaced GPT-3-like models anytime soon. This is because customer service requires emotional communication, giving emotional comfort to customers, GPT-3 cannot do that to customers.

### Q3 According to the author, what are some specific criticisms that have been made against GPT-3 like models? Give three criticisms

1. GPT-3 like models are just imitating the syntactic patterns of human language but is incapable of generating its own ideas or making complex decisions.
2.  GPT-3 will forever remain compromised by the biases and propaganda and misinformation in the data it has been trained on, meaning that using it for anything more than parlor tricks will always be irresponsible.
3. A.I. threatens to be even more transformative than social media in its ultimate effects, so there should be right kind of organization to manage them or we should not build them

### Q4 Why is it a societal problem if language models are simply “stochastic parrots”

Because in this case, language models cannot generate its own ideas, we risk as a society directing too many resources, both monetary and intellectual, in pursuit of a false oracle.

## Part 3: Open AI Remedies

### Q5  According to the article, roughly, a fifth of Open AI is focused on “safety” and “alignment”. What are some specific things they are doing to “align the technology with humanity’s interests”. Give two examples

1. reviewing ways in which the software is being used by outside developers.
2. creating new tools to reduce the risk of toxic speech or misinformation

## Part 4: Intelligence or Lack of

### Q6(1): From what you have learned in the course and/or the Johnson article, what arguments can be made to support the thesis that “higher-level understanding is emerging, thanks to the deep layers of the neural net”. Make two points. You can give specific applications/datasets/evaluations as examples or make more abstract arguments. 

1. Large language models have been making steady improvements, on standardized reading comprehension tests such as the comprehension skills DeepMind‘s L.L.M. were equivalent to that of an average high school student.
2. Also, OpenAI visual neural net called DALL-E  can generates complex images based on natural-language prompts like painting the characters from ‘Seinfeld’ in the style of Rembrandt.

### Q6(2): From what you have learned in the course and/or the Johnson article, what arguments can be made to support the thesis that “the program by definition can’t get to true understanding simply by playing ”guess the missing word” all day”. Make two points. You can give specific applications/datasets/evaluations as examples or make more abstract arguments 

1. DeepMind‘s L.L.M still perform poorly in logical and mathematical reasoning.
2. GPT-3 has no advance knowledge about syntax: There are no human-programmed algorithms to ensure that its subjects and verbs are in agreement.



## Part 5: Regulation

### Q7 Discuss your own thoughts with regard to the two questions at the end of the quote above (2 Points).

For the first question, I think the right kind of organization should be A non-profit organization involving scientists and sociologists from around the world. It should not be controlled by a single country, and resources and knowledge should be shared globally, with groups in each country monitoring the misuse of technology.

For the second question, I think we should build it because no one should stop the progress of technology, but in order to prevent the possible side effects, we should always monitor his development and prevent him from stepping into a situation that is detrimental to mankind
