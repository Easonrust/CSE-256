# Assignment 1: Text Classification

## How to Run

There are two python files:

- sentiment_2_1.py is for 2.1 Guided Feature Engineering
- sentiment_2_2.py is for 2.2 Independent Feature Engineering

Run "**python3  sentiment_2_1.py**" will generate the test results when n=1...4 and C range from 1...10. The code annotated can generate graphs of accuracy and C.

Run "**python3  sentiment_2_2.py**" will generate the test results when use stop_words only, use token_pattern and use both. In each situation, n is set to 1, C range from 1...10. The code annotated can generate graphs of accuracy and C.
